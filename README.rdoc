== Welcome to Rob's Call Handler Helper

This simple app allows users to sign-up and log calls for colleagues as well as checking calls
logged by others for themselves.

The navigation bar gives access to calls logged for the user and also logged by the user.

New calls are logged by clicking the 'New Call' option in the navigation bar.

== Technical info

The app uses Devise for authentication and Twitter Bootstrap for styling.
